# Watch

Watch anything instantaneously, just write its name.

It searches a magnet for you and streams it using [WebTorrent](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/webtorrent-cli/tree/iina-support) to your favorite app.

## Install

```shell
$ npm install -g @fabiospampinato/watch
```

## Usage

#### Wizard

Execute `watch` to run a wizard, it'll ask you everything it needs: a search query, which title to stream, and which app to use.

#### I'm Feeling Lucky

If you're feeling lucky, just run something like this to automatically pick the first result:

```shell
watch Star Wreck
```

#### WebTorrent Options

You can pass arbitrary options to [WebTorrent](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/webtorrent-cli/tree/iina-support), read more about them [here](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/webtorrent-cli/tree/iina-support). Just write them after the special `--` argument:

```shell
watch -- --vlc --port 1234
watch Star Wreck -- --vlc --port 1234
```
