Now:
  ☐ `Config.**.favorites` might be empty, ensuring proper defaulting
  ☐ Populate the `engine` key of package.json @high @1h
  ☐ Save files under ~/Downloads (configurable) @1h

Next:
  ☐ Properly detect default app @2h
  ☐ Add support for setting the favorite torrent providers (perhaps TPB is blocked or something)

Future:
  ☐ Add settings, so that we can default to a specific app @30m
